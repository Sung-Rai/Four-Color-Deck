# Four-Color-Deck

A downloadable version of FabianPEK's Four-Color deck mod on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/balatro/mods/4). Just some hastily put together stuff so I could enable/disable the skin in the mod menu. Also added a high-contrast version of the skin, and made it so that the suit text also changes colour.

# Requirements

# Installation

Extract and place the 'FourColorDeck' folder into the mod folder. (Probably in %appdata%/Balatro/Mods)
